## AppGoblin's 2025 Mobile SDK Report

We crunched the numbers for which mobile B2B SaaS companies saw the most or least growth in 2025.  View the full report [here](https://appgoblin.info/reports/mobile-apps-growth-sdks-2025).


The AppGoblin SDK Growth Report is based on a 50k app subset of AppGoblin's 200k apps that analyzed for SDKs in 2025. This smaller group of apps were selected for this report because they were analyzed in both H1 and H2 for an accurate comparison between the two periods. This is sample of the whole market and should be used as a guide rather than a definitive source.

## Top Growing Mobile Tech Companies in 2025

* Verve Holdings, which also owns [PubNative](https://appgoblin.info/companies/pubnative.com) and [Smaato](https://appgoblin.info/companies/smaato.com), launched their own SDK for behaivor targeting. Verve [self reports](https://verve.com/press/verve-group-atom-3-0-brings-id-less-on-device-behavioral-targeting-to-10000-apps/) this rolled out to 10k apps across their existing clients. PubNative and Smaato SDKs are counted separately, hence Verve's impressive percentage growth.
* X3M has been growing for a couple years but 2025 looks to have been a breakout year for them.
* Flarelane's push notification SDK has a small base of apps but it's growing rapidly.

## Top Shrinking Mobile Tech Companies in 2025



* Don't be fooled, though LiftOff saw shrinking trends, it's partnership/parent [Vungle](https://appgoblin.info/companies/vungle.com) saw a healthy increase. This isn't necessarily an issue as their older app clients are absorbed into Vungle. A similar situation can be observed for AdColony (Digital Turbine) and MoPub (AppLovin).
* Flurry saw a decline in integrations that was not reflected in Yahoo!'s flat growth.

## All Mobile Tech Companies in 2025

* Revenue boosting companies like [RevenueCat](https://appgoblin.info/companies/revenuecat.com) and [SuperWall](https://appgoblin.info/companies/superwall.com) saw good growth. Though it will take more time to tell, they had even more growth in new apps in 2025, which didn't make it into the totals for this report. 
* AirBridge saw a great boost in growth. Their MMP offering is growing rapidly.
* [PostHog](https://appgoblin.info/companies/posthog.com) and [Parse.ly](https://appgoblin.info/companies/parse.ly) saw great growth. These more business / developer focused analytics platforms are growing rapidly.
