## ASO Keywords are still key in 2025

It's 2025 and mobile app discoverability continues to decline, but that just means that your organic keyword discovery is more important than ever to get that edge up when you're growth hacking your app or game. AppGoblin keyword rankings show you where each app ranks for various keywords.


## New UA Reports

AppGoblin is now putting out [free monthly user aquisition for a high level overview of the state of mobile app advertising.](https://appgoblin.info/reports)  Good take aways from these reports are which creatives performed the best this past month for advertisers and which apps saw the biggest inreases in installs after running ad campaigns.

## More Creatives

Backend was refactored to include any creative from ad networks now rather than only those attributable to an app. This means there was a big increase in the creatives on AppGoblin, but more work to be done to match advertisers to their ads.
