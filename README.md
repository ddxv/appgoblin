### Project Structure

1.  Python Litestar backend API found in `backend/`
2.  Javascript SvelteKit+Tailwind UI found in `frontend/`

### Data & Database

The database referred to in this repository is created by [adscrawler](https://github.com/ddxv/adscrawler), a crawler for scraping the Google & Apple play stores and storing that to a PostgreSQL database. That repo also contains a number of materialized views prepping data for the dashboard. It generally would be difficult to recreate it as it's only ever been managed by me the original creator, but I'm open to sharing data if you have something you need.

### API Service

`litestar run --debug` to start API. Once run, api documentation can be found at `api/docs`

### Setup

- Current setup is based on Python3.12
- pip install dependencies, found in pyproject.toml: `pip install`

### Running

- To run locally for testing use
  - Backend: in `backend/` run `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app:app` or `litestar run dev`
  - Frontend: in `frontend` run `npm run dev`
- This repo includes the scripts used to run in production as well. These are located in the steps in `.github/actions` as well as `scripts` for systemd services for frontend and backend.
- Additionally, you will need a proxy. I used Nginx. This is wherever you have your nginx configuration set, possibly sites-available `/etc/nginx/sites-available/appgoblin-api` or `/etc/nginx/conf.d/appgoblin-api.conf`
