## What's new for app marketing and ASO in 2025? 

2025 is seeing rapid growth and AppGoblin is no exception. We've shifted from a simple free side project to a full-fledged free app marketing platform with a ton of market intelligence and cutting edge features not available on other platforms let alone for free. That being said, there is a long way to go to backfill other older features which users might expect. This post is to flesh those ideas out a bit and see what we should work on next.

## ASO Tools

There are a TON of ASO tools out there so lets do a quick overview of what we do and don't have so far:

* App keywords: We currently have a variety of keyword tracking for each app so you can track it's organic rank for any keyword. You can see how your competitors rank and how many other apps are also using that same keyword.
* App ranks: We have free ranking data for all apps on the App Store and Google Play Store. See the organic rank of any app for any keyword.
* Keyword ranks over time*: We're now tracking this data, but we'll need to build out better analytics tools so you can see how your keyword ranks have changed over time.

## Comparison tools

I think this would be super useful for marketers to directly compare one app against another without needing open a tab to see both on AppGoblin at the same time.  This would also be a great way to compare companies to each other as well.


### SDK reaserch analysis

This is probably the most popular feature on AppGoblin currently. It seems that many companies want to use this to do competitor analysis or for building their CRM for potential clients. Currently we need to work on the underlying data as Apple has made some recent changes that make gathering iOS IPA files a bit more difficult.


## 2025 Cutting Edge Features

I've always wanted to be able to share more data about what data apps collect about their users. AppGoblin shows you the permissions an app asks for and the data it collects, but this is a bit obfuscated from the real data apps collect and share, usually via third party SDKs.  

The issue was that just looking at the SDKs in the static apps was not a deterministic way of knowing how or what data was collected. AppGoblin's new features will be to dynamically run each app and extract the real data it collects and where that data is sent.

### Dynamic App Analysis for Research

The new features will be:

* List of URLs and IPs* Where is the app calling out to including which AppGoblin companies they are associated with.
* List of data collected* What data is collected from the user including example JSON payloads so you can see what something like "location" might actually mean.
* Geo tagging * What is the country of the IPs/URLs the app is calling out to.


### Ad Analysis

In the collection of above, we'll also be able to start collecting ads as they are displayed in apps. This is useful for app marketers and app advertisers to see what kinds of ads are being display in which apps / from which ad networks.










### App-Ads.txt

Check each apps app-ads.txt file to see which ad networks are used by the app.
