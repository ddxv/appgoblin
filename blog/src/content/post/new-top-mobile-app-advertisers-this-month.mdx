## Top Advertisers vs Top Monetization Publishers

I'm happy to announce that AppGoblin's latest ad network rankings based on our scans of live mobile app ads. While AppGoblin's existing SDK scans show which apps are monetizing with which ad networks or working with a specific SDK or company, they don't answer the crucial question: **which apps are buying ads?**

Now on AppGoblin you can browse [this month's in-app advertisers and their creatives](https://appgoblin.info/ad-creatives). This is crucial information that helps mobile marketers see the actual trends and ads that their competitors are running. Additionally, B2B businesses may find this useful as a way to find which apps are currently buying ads.

## Example: Water Sort

I'll choose Water Sort because personally I see ads for this game all the time. On [Water Sort's AppGoblin page for Ad Creatives you can see each Water Sort creatives](https://appgoblin.info/apps/water.sort.puzzle.game.color.sorting.free/ad-creatives) that AppGoblin matched.

Next head to [Water Sort's Ad Placements Water Sort's ad placements on various ad networks](https://appgoblin.info/apps/water.sort.puzzle.game.color.sorting.free/ad-creatives). Here is each instance of a creative that has been seen on each ad network. The host refers to which domain was hosting the ad and the Ad is the one that initially sent the ad. Any additional companies that were in either HTTP request are included in the additional ad networks column.

Here you can see that [Appreciate.mobi](appgoblin.info/companies/appreciate.mobi) is the DSP (owned by [DigitalTurbine](https://appgoblin.info/companies/appreciate.mobi)) where the ad is coming from and the publishing apps (the games monetizing with Appreciate) where the creative for Water Sort was shown.

Finally, clicking on any placement will take you to that placements page, where future details will be added.


## Ad Network Analysis
Along with which apps are buying ads, you can also see their MMP and ad network information. For SDK ad networks this is straight forward and for programmatic it lets you understand the more complex nature of daisy-chained SSP - Exchange - DSP and how they also end up relating to the network the buyers are on.
